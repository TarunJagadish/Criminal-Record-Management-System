# Criminal-Record-Management-System


The goal of the Criminal Record Management System is to replace the current manual system using computerized tools and full-fledged computer applications, meeting the needs of all police officers so that their important data/information can be processed for a longer period of time while still being easily accessible. The required applications and hardware are readily accessible and simple to use. This system also keeps computerized logs of all the criminal complaints filed. The key goal of this initiative is to warn any police officer in the country about every criminal's release, including the criminal's id, name, and form of crime. It could be used by the police department to keep track of the various events relevant to the First Information Report. Many of these operations (such as complaint filing and information updating) are handled in this framework, which saves time. This application is for the police stations that provide facilities for reporting crimes, filing FIR and maintaining prisoner records. It provides better prospective for the enhancement of organization regarding quality and transparency.
